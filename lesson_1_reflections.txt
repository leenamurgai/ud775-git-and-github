How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
	- We can quickly find locations of differences in the file so you can see what's changed

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
	- When things go wrong you can easily go back and compare the changes to see what broke it
	- You can make changes and try things out without worrying about breaking things because you can always go back to a previous version

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
	- Con: Human error
	- Pro: More logical and organised commits

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
	- Some types of repositories have interdependence between files and others do not.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
	- "git log" returns {commit_ID, author, date, comment} for each commit
	- "git diff commit_ID_1 commit_ID_2" returns diff output
	- "dit diff" --stat" returns stats on which files changed and by how much

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
	- because it's always possible to revert back

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
	- code
	- LaTeX
